## About Me

- I'm currently learning how to write programs in Elixir. It's pretty different, but I like how scalable it is.

- Ask me about my favorite projects and how I like to learn.

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficient in: Python3, front-end stack (HTML, CSS, & JS), mySQL, Google firebase, Ubuntu Linux, and C#.
- Skills: Swift, React Native, Node.js, git, and a little Java.
